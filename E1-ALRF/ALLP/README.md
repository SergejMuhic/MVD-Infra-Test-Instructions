## Summary

*Include a short description of the test case.*

*Optional: if your data comes from a specific Storyline or unit test of the IFC Infrastructure Deployment Project or IFC Rail Project, please include a link to the originating documentation here. so additional background information can be created.*

With these instructions the baseline stationing and linear positioning exchange will be established between various domains. This includes basic alignment featuring the common layout described in TC1.1:
- horizontal
- vertical

and the stationing and relative positioning concepts where physical elements can be placed relative to positioning elements. In order to accomplish a semantic description of a station, property sets will be used on referents.

A typical alignment also features reference markers as embedded elements for relative positioning along known locations along the alignment.

## Variations
The Following occurence variations need to be checked and certified in relation to the targetted entities and concept templates:

- Entity_01 - *decription of variation*
- Entity_02 - *decription of variation*


## Usages
The following itemised restrictions and constraints shall be placed on IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

- IfcSomething
    - *Constraint*


The Test case requires the following additional checks related to Model Geometry:

- *Constraint*


## Model Dataset
This test case utilises the attached dataset documented by the following drawings and data schedule. 

*This is a later step tha involved the detailed documentation of the certification dataset (model)*


## Drawings (Visualisations)
The following Drawings and visualisations describe the test case dataset to be modelled and certified.
