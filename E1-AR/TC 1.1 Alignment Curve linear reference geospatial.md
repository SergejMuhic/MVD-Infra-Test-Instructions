## Summary

*Include a short description of the test case.*

*Optional: if your data comes from a specific Storyline or unit test of the IFC Infrastructure Deployment Project or IFC Rail Project, please include a link to the originating documentation here. so additional background information can be created.*

With these instructions the baseline alignment exchange will be established between various domains. This includes basic alignment geometry featuring the common layout:
- horizontal
- vertical

The valid geometry segment types for horizontal are the following:
- Arc
- Clothoid
- Cubic (? has to be covered somewhere)
- Linear

The valid geometry segment types for vertical:
- Arc
- Linear
- Parabolic (?does Road use it?)

## Itemised Roots
The Test instruction addresses the import and export of the following IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

- IFC Entities
    - *IfcAlignment*
    - *IfcAlignmnetHorizontal*
    - *IfcAlignmentVertical*
    - *IfcAlignmentSegment*
    - *IfcAlignmentHorizontalSegment*
    - *IfcAlignmentVerticalSegment*
    - *IfcAxis2PlacementLinear*
    - *IfcCircle*
    - *IfcClothoid*
    - *IfcCompositeCurve*
    - *IfcLine*
    - *IfcCurveSegment*
    - *IfcGeometricRepresentationContext*
    - *IfcGeometricRepresentationSubContext*
    - *IfcGradientCurve*
    - *IfcMapConversion*
    - *IfcPolyline*
    - *IfcProject*
    - *IfcProjectedCRS*
    - *IfcProductDefinitionShape*
    - *IfcSite*
    - *IfcShapeRepresentation*
- Concept Templates
    - *Alignment Layout*
    - *Alignmnent Geomtry*
    - *Alignmnet Geometry Gradient*
    - *Project Global Positioning*
    - *Spatial Containment*

## Variations
The Following occurence variations need to be checked and certified in relation to the targetted entities and concept templates:

- Entity_01 - *decription of variation*
- Entity_02 - *decription of variation*


## Usages
The following itemised restrictions and constraints shall be placed on IFC Entities & Concept Templates:

- IfcSomething
    - *Constraint*


The Test case requires the following additional checks related to Model Geometry:

- *Constraint*


## Model Dataset
This test case utilises the attached dataset documented by the following drawings and data schedule. 

*This is a later step tha involved the detailed documentation of the certification dataset (model)*


## Drawings (Visualisations)
The following Drawings and visualisations describe the test case dataset to be modelled and certified.
